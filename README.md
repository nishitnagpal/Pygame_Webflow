# Webflow
Webflow is the leading visual development platform for designing, building, and launching powerful websites visually. Using Webflow, I designed a website to showcase all the Pygame projects I have developed.

Webflow hosted website : https://retro-style-python-games.webflow.io/

The following are Pygame projects that I have added to a website designed with Webflow:

Snake Game: 
Github Repo - https://github.com/nishitnagpal/Pygame_Snake
Github Pages Link - https://nishitnagpal.github.io/Pygame_Snake/

Bricks Game: 
Github Repo - https://github.com/nishitnagpal/Pygame_bricks
Github Pages Link - https://nishitnagpal.github.io/Pygame_bricks/

Hangman Game: 
Github Repo - https://github.com/nishitnagpal/Pygame_Hangman
Github Pages Link - https://nishitnagpal.github.io/Pygame_Hangman/

Tic-Tac-Toe Game: 
Github Repo - https://github.com/nishitnagpal/Pygame_TicTacToe
Github Pages Link - https://nishitnagpal.github.io/Pygame_TicTacToe/

By utilizing the Webflow Exporter, I obtained the source code for the Webflow website, which I have subsequently uploaded to this GitHub repository. This process ensures that the website's code is available for review, collaboration, and further development.
