# Webflow
Webflow is the leading visual development platform for designing, building, and launching powerful websites visually. Using Webflow, I designed a website to showcase all the Pygame projects I have developed.

[Webflow hosted website](https://retro-style-python-games.webflow.io/)

The following are Pygame projects that I have added to a website designed with Webflow:

[Snake Game](https://nishitnagpal.github.io/Pygame_Snake/): <br/>
Github Repo - https://github.com/nishitnagpal/Pygame_Snake

[Bricks Game](https://nishitnagpal.github.io/Pygame_bricks/): 
Github Repo - https://github.com/nishitnagpal/Pygame_bricks

[Hangman Game](https://nishitnagpal.github.io/Pygame_Hangman/): 
Github Repo - https://github.com/nishitnagpal/Pygame_Hangman

[Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://nishitnagpal.github.io/Pygame_TicTacToe/): 
Github Repo - https://github.com/nishitnagpal/Pygame_TicTacToe

By utilizing the Webflow Exporter, I obtained the source code for the Webflow website, which I have subsequently uploaded to this GitHub repository. This process ensures that the website's code is available for review, collaboration, and further development.
